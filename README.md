## AHP Method
Here we will implement the AHP method to aid in multi-variable multi-criteria decisions. The problem chosen at hand is that of which beer brand to buy. This problem has been chosen given its usefullness in day to day life and the easiness to find willing subjects to give input on the different wheightings between criteria and beer brands. 

The implementation will be done with the use of the package AHPy 2.0 found at https://pypi.org/project/ahpy/
